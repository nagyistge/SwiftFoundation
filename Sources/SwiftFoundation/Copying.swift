/// The copy returned is immutable if the consideration “immutable vs. mutable” applies to the receiving object; otherwise the exact nature of the copy is determined by the class.

/// **Use Case:** Classes that incapsuate information that need to be passed by reference (can't be structs), but need copying for thread safety, immutablility etc.
